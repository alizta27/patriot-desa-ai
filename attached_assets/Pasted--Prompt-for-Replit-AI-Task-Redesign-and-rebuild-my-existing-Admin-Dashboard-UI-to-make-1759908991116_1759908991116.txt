> **Task:** Redesign and rebuild my existing Admin Dashboard UI to make it look like a professional modern admin dashboard.
>
> **Goals:**
>
> 1. Make the UI visually polished, consistent, and responsive.
> 2. Add a left sidebar (for navigation), a top header (for title, profile, and logout), and clean main content sections.
> 3. Include common admin dashboard features and missing UI parts that would enhance usability (like search bar, notifications, analytics cards, data tables, etc.).
> 4. Add proper layout with menu button toggle for sidebar (mobile-friendly).
> 5. Include logout button functionality (for now, mock only).
> 6. Replace all API calls with mock APIs (fetch from JSON or placeholder functions) â€” Iâ€™ll connect real APIs later.
> 7. Keep the code modular, reusable, and cleanly structured.
>
> **Tech Preferences (adjust if needed):**
>
> * Frontend: React (with Tailwind CSS or your preferred styling system)
> * Use a component-based structure (e.g., `Sidebar`, `Header`, `DashboardHome`, `UsersPage`, `SettingsPage`, etc.)
> * Include routing (e.g., React Router) for navigating between pages.
> * If using icons, use something like `lucide-react` or `react-icons`.
> * Optional: Add simple charts using `recharts` or `chart.js` for analytics/overview.
>
> **Pages inside admin dashboard:**
>
> * Dashboard (overview with cards, charts, quick stats)
> * Users management (table of users, add/edit/delete mock functionality)
> * Settings (account settings, system configuration)
> * Logs or Activity (optional but good to include)
>
> **Visual Style References:**
>
> * Clean, modern admin layout (e.g., like TailAdmin, Shadcn UI, or MUI dashboards)
> * Light and dark mode support if easy
>
> **Output Expectations:**
>
> * A complete working React project or updated version of my current admin dashboard UI
> * Include sample data in mock APIs
> * Organized folder structure: `/components`, `/pages`, `/api/mock`, `/assets`, etc.
> * Well-commented code, easy to extend later.
>
> **Example structure suggestion:**
>
> ```
> src/
>   components/
>     Sidebar.jsx
>     Header.jsx
>     Card.jsx
>   pages/
>     Dashboard.jsx
>     Users.jsx
>     Settings.jsx
>   api/
>     mock/
>       users.js
>       stats.js
>   App.jsx
>   main.jsx
>   index.css
> ```
>
> **Final Objective:**
> Create a professional, clean, and user-friendly admin dashboard layout ready for API integration later.
